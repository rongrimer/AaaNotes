EI detailed summary about qutting work
	Main points
	- Wasn't really able to directly communicate with my supoervisor and manager about my job duties and responsibilities taking its toll on my well being which was my mistake. (Working as the stand alone QA tech for the night production shift instead of having 2 technicians in that shift were I can have a support and assist when serious issue arises.  Also, due to the fact that my supervisor, manager, and the morning QA tech, with all the experienced plant operators are all in the morning shift. This made me feel like I had my workload was too heavy for me) By letting them know about my concerns about the workload I was doing at that time (after my colleague got fired), the turnout/result could be different on me still be working at the company. Instead, I told them the reason that I was leaving is because I wanted to go and study again to take certifications related to information technology (field that I graduated in) which I'm currently doing at the moment and at the same time looking for jobs related to it.


	- Due to that, I've decided to hand in  my resignation notice (turned it up to them around 2nd week of November). Through gratitude from them, I let them know that I can train the new person till the 1st week of January (January 7th of this year was my last day) so that I can hand off my work and the transition goes smoothly to the new hire.
