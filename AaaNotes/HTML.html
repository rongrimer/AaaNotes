HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
- gives content structure and meaning by defining that content
 : in simple terms, HTML represnts contents.
- HTML should be written inside of a CSS document/file and vice versa.
- HTML is hand in hand with CSS but they are both independent of one another.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- a presentation language created to style the appearance of content (which is the HTML) using for example the fonts or colors.

Three major sections for structure of a web page:
> Entire page - <html> and </html>
> Heading section - <head> and </head>
> Body of the page - <body> and </body>
- The heading section of the page is used for various purposes, generally instructing the browser on how to mange the page.
- The body section contaings all the content that will be displayed on-screen by the browser for the page

Three common HTML terms:
> Elements
> Tags
> Attributes

Elements
- designators that defines the structure and the content of objects within a page. 
- frequently used elements include multiple levels of:
	} headings (identified as <h1> throguh <h6> elements)
	} paragraphs (identified as the <p> element)
	} list goes on to include the <a>, <div>, <span>, <strong>, and <em> 			elements and many more.
- elements are idetified by the use of the less-than and greater-than angle brackets, < and >, surrounding the element name (ex. <a>, <div>, etc)
- elements with no content are called empty elements. (ex. <a>, <br>, <div>, etc. - basically any element without a closing tag.)

Tags
- the use of less-than and greater-than angle brackets surrounding an element creates what is known as a tag. It most commonly occur in pairs of opening and closing tags.
	} opening tag - marks the beginning of an element. It consists of a 		less-than sign followed by an element's name, and then ends with a 			great-than sign.(ex. <div>)
	} closing  tag - marks the end of an element. It consists of a less-than 			sign followed by a forward slash (/) and the element's name, and then 			ends with a greater-than sign. (ex. </div>)

- content in between the opening and closing tags is the content of that 
element.
- anchor link, for example will have an opening tag of <a> and a closing tag of </a>. Content between the two tag, opening and closing tags will be the content of the anchor link. (ex. <a>...</a>)

Attributes
- properties that used to provide additional information about an element. The most common attirbutes include: 
	} the (id) attribute, which identifies an element (id = identifier)
	} the (src) attribute, which specifies a source for embeddable content
	} the (href) attribute, which provied a hyperlink reference to a linked 		resource
- attributes are defined within the opening tag, alfter an element's name. It generally includes a name and a value. The format for these attributes consists of attribute name followed by an equals sign and then a quoted value. for example:
	} <a href="**insert url link here**">**value - either a string, or 			number, int, double, float, integer, etc.**</a>
		} the code above will diplay the text/value on the web page and will 				take user to a url link upon clicking the
- other attribute lists:
	}
